WIP: Personal applications for gathering transactional data from Mint, analyzing, and displaying it (in a way that I think is more useful that Mint).

I'm just using Mint since YNAB costs money and it's an easy way to scrape transactions from various credit cards and banks. Mint does not have a API so I have to use Selenium to scrape it.
